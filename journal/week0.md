# Weekly commitment June 24, 2024 - June 27, 2024
In this week, I created an admin user and set up AWS credentials, followed by installing the AWS CLI on Gitpod. I established the budget using the AWS CLI on Gitpod, utilizing JSON files for both the budget and budget notifications located in the AWS/JSON folder. Additionally, I used a JSON file to set up a billing alarm, which involved first creating a new SNS topic and confirming the subscription via email before creating the actual CloudWatch alarm through the AWS CLI.
